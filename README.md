Manage WordPress Posts Using Bulk Edit and Quick Edit
=====================================================

I wrote a tutorial for how to "Manage WordPress Posts Using Bulk Edit and Quick Edit"
and decided it was best to convert my tutorial to plugin format and post online so
I can better manage and keep up to date.

You can view the tutorial at http://wpdreamer.com/2012/03/manage-wordpress-posts-using-bulk-edit-and-quick-edit

With that said, you could easily take this code and paste it into your theme's functions.php file.
Just check the manage_wp_posts_using_bulk_quick_edit_enqueue_admin_scripts() function to make
sure you're enqueuing the right javascript file.

With that said, you could easily take this code and paste it into your theme's functions.php file.
There is, however, an included javascript file so be sure to check the
manage_wp_posts_using_bulk_quick_edit_enqueue_admin_scripts() function to confirm you're
enqueueing the right javascript file.

Also, after a few requests for custom field examples other than text boxes, I updated the
tutorial to include a select dropdown and a radio button.

Custom Fields:
'Release Date - input text
'Coming Soon' - input radio
'Film Rating' - select dropdown

If you find any issues with the tutorial, or code, please let me know. Thanks!
